# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project  

A complete **data warehousing and analytics pipeline** I built to showcase skills in **data engineering, data modeling, and analytics**.  
The project takes raw data from multiple sources, processes it through **ETL pipelines**, and delivers **business-ready insights** using a modern data warehouse architecture.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  
I implemented the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:  

- **🥉 Bronze Layer** – Raw data ingestion from CSV files into SQL Server.  
- **🥈 Silver Layer** – Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization.  
- **🥇 Gold Layer** – Business-ready data modeled into a **star schema** for analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview  

- **Data Architecture**: Designed a warehouse using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Built extraction, transformation, and loading processes.  
- **Data Modeling**: Developed fact and dimension tables optimized for queries.  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Wrote SQL reports to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
